<h2><strong> Conclusion </strong></h2><br>
The accounting systems in place for small enterprises vary a lot. There are cases when there
are no accounting requirements at all and cases where the accounting requirements are
relatively strict for small enterprises. However, in practical terms, all small enterprises will
need to keep some kind of financial records in order to keep financial control over their
businesses. This report summarizes the likely accounting systems from the point of view of
small enterprises and identifies some good practices on how to improve the accounting
systems for small enterprises. The objective of this report is to provide views on how to
improve the accounting systems so that they can provide the owners/managers of the small
enterprises with appropriate financial information. The aim is not to add to regulation but to
identify good practices which small enterprises may consider before deciding on an
appropriate accounting system. However, these recommendations are in no way intended to
encroach upon the sovereignty accounting matters. <br><br>
